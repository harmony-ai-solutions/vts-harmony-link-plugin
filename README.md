**Harmony.AI VTube Studio Plugin** is an AI powered voice assistant capable of controlling a VTuber model
in VTube Studio, in combination with Harmony.AI's [Harmony Link AI Middleware](https://project-harmony.ai/technology/). 
It's a Fork of [JarikDem-Bot/ai-waifu](https://github.com/JarikDem-Bot/ai-waifu).

This project is meant to create an engaging experience combining the charm of anime characters brought to life with cutting-edge technologies.
It allows you to interact with desired character in real-time without powerful hardware.

By forking and adapting the initial repo to work with our Harmony Link Middleware, we allow for fully local setup without cloud services,
as well as participating in newest developments in AI Technology for creating realistic AI Characters.

## Features

## Installation

To run this project, you need:
1. Download [Harmony Link](https://project-harmony.ai/technology/) or set it up using Docker via [Quickstart Repository](https://github.com/harmony-ai-solutions/quickstart).
2. Clone the repository by running `git clone https://github.com/harmony-ai-solutions/vts-harmony-link-plugin.git` or download the repository as a .zip file from Github and extract it. 
3. Install and set up [VTube Studio](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1325860/VTube_Studio/)
    <details>
      <summary>Settings: </summary>
      
      - Tick the Checkbox to `Start API (allow plugins)`:
        ![Enable API in VTS](docs/images/vts-api-enable.PNG)
   
      - Once you start the Plugin later, allow the connection:
        ![Allow Plugin Connection](docs/images/vts-allow-plugin.PNG)
    </details>
4. Check `harmony.ini` whether all Settings are fine. Usually you don't need to make any changes if you have a default Microphone and Speaker defined.
5. Start Harmony Link (if it's not running already) and local services AI (as needed).
6. Run the project by executing `run_windows.bat` or `run_linux.sh` in the project directory. This will download and launch Micromamba, install all python dependencies and launch the application.
7. To enable / disable microphone recording, press `V`, or the key you defined in `harmony.ini` for the toggle.

## About Project Harmony.AI
![Project Harmony.AI](docs/images/Harmony-Main-Banner-200px.png)
### Our goal: Elevating Human <-to-> AI Interaction beyond known boundaries.
Project Harmony.AI emerged from the idea to allow for a seamless living together between AI-driven characters and humans.
Since it became obvious that a lot of technologies required for achieving this goal are not existing or still very experimental,
the long term vision of Project Harmony is to establish the full set of technologies which help minimizing biological and
technological barriers in Human <-to-> AI Interaction.

### Our principles: Fair use and accessibility
We want to counter today's tendencies of AI development centralization at the hands of big
corporations. We're pushing towards maximum transparency in our own development efforts, and aim for our software to be
accessible and usable in the most democratic ways possible.

Therefore, for all our current and future software offerings, we'll perform a constant and well-educated evaluation whether
we can safely open source them in parts or even completely, as long as this appears to be non-harmful towards achieving
the project's main goal.
